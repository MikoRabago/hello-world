My Hello World project.

“The purpose of life is finding the largest burden that you can bear and bearing it.” - Jordan Peterson
I live, to live this line, for all of my life.

Extended bio:
Aspires to be a physician-scientist. I want to live my life to the fullest of my capability. And I want to live every day of my life knowing to myself that I really did my best, and only I knew my best.
Every day is a mental game between me and my mind trying to figure out the best version of me. I want everyone to know that I will take every responsibility and accountability that I should take in everywhere I go in life. 
I am doing all of these because I believed this to be my purpose here on Earth: to live the best that I could in this life that God gave me.
One day, I will look back on myself and say "I am happy to do all of the things that I wanted to do within me."
